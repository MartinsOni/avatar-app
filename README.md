# Fullstack Messageboard


I will be building a fullstack application which serves as an online messageboard. Features of this application include a full REST API, with user data stored in a MongoDB server. Users should be able to register, login, view, create, update and delete posts.

### Backend

The backend is stored in the `/server` folder

The purpose of these tasks is to create a REST API which will serve the frontend

This REST API will do the following:

- allow users to view all posts
- allow users to view a single post
- allow users to register
- allow users to login
- allow users to create a new post
- allow users to edit a their previous posts
- allow users to delete previous posts

### Frontend

I will be using React Js for the Front end (Client)
