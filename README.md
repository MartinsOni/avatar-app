# Fullstack Messageboard


I will be building a fullstack application which serves as an online messageboard. Features of this application include a full REST API, with user data stored in a MongoDB server. Users should be able to register, login, view, create, update and delete posts.

### Backend

The backend is stored in the `/server` folder

The purpose of these tasks is to create a REST API which will serve the frontend

This REST API will do the following:

- allow users to view all posts
- allow users to view a single post
- allow users to register
- allow users to login
- allow users to create a new post
- allow users to edit a their previous posts
- allow users to delete previous posts

### Frontend

For the frontend, it is largely up to you how present the information to the user. You should be thinking in terms of "what features would my users want?"

The tasks are largely non-specific and should be viewed as a guide to help you structure your application. Completing this tasks on their own will not provide you a fully functioning frontend application.
